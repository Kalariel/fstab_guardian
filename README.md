Never brick your system again with a malformed fstab!

## What it does
- Validates fstab syntax before boot
- Auto-recovery from backup if fstab is corrupted  
- Clear status reporting

## FYI
It's just a personnal project to explore script writing and testing, it may already existe, I don't know
